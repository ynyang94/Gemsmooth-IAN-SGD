# Gemsmooth-IAN-SGD
## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository provides the implementation for our paper:

> **"Adaptive Gradient Normalization and Independent Sampling for (Stochastic) Generalized-Smooth Optimization"**  
> *(Accepted with Minor Revision at Transactions on Machine Learning Research, 2025)*


## ðŸ“‚ Code Structure

- `DRO/` â€” Contains implementation of **regularized f-DRO** plus Life expectancy data we used during experiment.
- `Phase_retrieval/` â€” Contains code for **phase retrieval experiments**.
- `Deep_Learning/` - Contains training codes for ResNet18/50 over CIFAR-10


## ðŸ”— Acknowledgements

The implementation of **DRO experiments** and **phase retrieval benchmarks** is based on the code from:
